         because they fart a lot. The Golden Retriever is a happy-go-lucky clown.
         He's reliable, trustworthy, calm, friendly, gentle and confident. He's
         very eager to please you. He isn't a one-man dog because
        everybody. He's friendly with all dogs and strangers. He's highly
        intelligent and trainable. He's very active and energetic. He loves to
         romp, run and play outdoors and he loves to swim. He's gentle and
         patient with kids, even bratty ones! He loves to play games and have
         fun. He's athletic, agile and fast on his feet.</p></div>


      <div class="tab-pane" id="huskies"><p>
        Huskies are majestic. Bred to be a sled dog, the Siberian Husky
        makes a great all-around dog. They are agreeable, alert, and outgoing.
        They have amazing endurance, and are always willing to work and want
         something to do, so they need at least an hour of exercise per day. They
         also need to be around people or other dogs at all times. They need
          companionship. A bored or lonely Siberian is a destructive Siberian tearing up couches and
           cushions. They can easily destroy your house and yard if they decide
           it's a good idea (and they probably will at some point). Siberians
            also love to dig!

          Pugs are so ugly they are cute.
          Pugs are small dogs with big personalities. They live to love
           and to be loved and were bred for one reason: to be your companion.
           They will try to live in your lap, eat your food, and
           sleep on your bed. They are incredibly playful, outgoing, adaptable,
           happy, lively, and affectionate
          </p></div>
